A new version of qube is available! This version features the beta events functionality, as well as some nice office improvements:

## FEWER TEMPTATIONS
We get it. Large red buttons, anything labeled ‘self-destruct’, buttons without ‘Are you sure?’ prompts - they’re tempting, even if, you know, you’re killing a meeting for dozens of annoyed co-workers. Well, temptation removed! The ‘end meeting’ button is no longer available (unless you’re an admin) in meeting rooms and common areas.

## NO MORE POPCORN
Inviting an entire department or the entire company? You will no longer be overloaded with a deluge of arrival notifications.

## EXTREME WORKING
Some remote workers are pushing boundaries when it comes to definitions of acceptable Internet conditions and remote working. You know who you are. Well, qube will now cater to your austere Internet overlords. You will no longer flicker for everyone else! You will be notified when your Internet connection is too unstable to use! You will be able to hide your poor WiFi choices (in qube, at least).

## SECOND CHANCES
Not everyone looks at instruction manuals or introductory emails - at least until you finally admit defeat to the Ikea table that seriously looked so easy to construct two hours ago. I mean, obviously you’ve read our qube intro emails, because they’re awesome - but in case you didn’t, now they’re always one click away.

## THOUGHT BUBBLES
Ever wonder what someone is thinking? Us too. Hover over someone in the office layout to see who they are and what they’re up to.

## HASSLE-FREE ROOM RENAMES
So previously, when the office was too busy, you had to wait in line to rename your room. This is like what happens at the DMV. It turns out that not every real-life experience should be translated over to the virtual.

## SHARE THE SPOTLIGHT
Hover over someone in the side panel, and we’ll spotlight the entire room your person of interest is in. Your person of interest will still jump up and down excitedly, but you’ll also get a chance to see which room they’re in and who else is there.

## SPOTLIGHT THE INVISIBLE
Hover over someone who’s offline in the side panel, and we’ll show you their office. No more hiding!

## YOUR PERSONAL WINGMAN
Exciting news. qube is now a wingman. Set yourself to “Feeling social”, and we’ll let you know if anyone else is ready to socialize too!

## EVENTS BETA
It’s finally here! You can now start using our conferences feature for support or training purposes! Email us to get started. Note that we will want to keep usage limited customers during the beta.
