<h1>qube v5 Release Notes</h1>

<p class="view">by nikhila</p>

<p>We’re pleased to announce that construction on our expanded virtual headquarters is mostly complete! We offer you:</p>

<h2 id="the-rise-of-a-new-skyscraper">THE RISE OF A NEW SKYSCRAPER</h2>

<p>Well, the tallest qube installation is only at three floors right now. But extrapolating from this month’s hiring and last month’s stretch goal success, one day we’ll need a tall and sophisticated (virtual) skyscraper to <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/2b/b0/882bb08f224b6f2e247fbbcc4b73d869.jpg">compete</a> <a href="https://cdn.archpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Base-rainier-square-tower.jpg">with</a> <a href="https://photos.travelblog.org/Photos/8376/42294/f/350991-Cool-Skyscraper-0.jpg">these</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-classy-modern-elevator-experience">A CLASSY MODERN ELEVATOR EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>Cliché startups have ping pong tables and weird office furniture. But super cool companies <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51c0c464e4b0d4df8521e78f/t/58c2c9221e5b6c71381cde6c/1489160523128/IMG_6071.jpg">have</a> <a href="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_900,c_fill,g_auto,h_506,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F120206044602-elevators-aquadom.jpg">super</a> <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e1/66/47/e16647561c41b37384efa82f76d08f8b.jpg">awesome</a> <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/5a/38/835a38d9b0ab590b0d3e50abd97aca54.jpg">elevators</a>, and we are no different. Click on the qube icon (lower righthand corner) to change floors and start your journey today.</p>

<p><img src="/pages/elevator_buttons.png" alt="floors" /></p>

<h2 id="a-google-like-search-with-advanced-indexing-and-sorting">A GOOGLE-LIKE SEARCH WITH ADVANCED INDEXING AND SORTING</h2>

<p>Oh, wait. That might be <a href="https://www.seeq.com/">Seeq</a>. Anyway, we’re happy to offer you a new and improved side panel where you can responsively search for your favorite people and sort by room, floor, etcetera.</p>

<h2 id="a-sense-of-belonging">A SENSE OF BELONGING</h2>

<p>We’ve added support for departments! This also means that you can invite everyone from a department into a conference room and sort coworkers by department in the side panel. You can only belong to one department, so the time has come to decide where your allegiances lay.</p>

<h2 id="relocation-benefits">RELOCATION BENEFITS</h2>

<p>Moving away from your favorite people is harrowing. Even if you’re only moving one floor up, and your friends are just a virtual elevator ride away. It’s just that you won’t be able to see them at all times in an oddly comforting manner when you look at qube, and that’s important, okay?</p>

<p>We’ve got your back. Pin the offices of the people you talk to (like?) most on other floors (click the star icon in the upper right corner of any office). You’ll be able to see and knock on their offices without having to change floors.</p>

<h2 id="meaningless-rebranding">MEANINGLESS REBRANDING</h2>

<p>When new features or products fail to get the recognition or awareness it deserves, a relatively pointless and possibly expensive rebranding effort should immediately commence. Or at least that what we’ve learned from sketchy ad agencies. So we are accordingly rebranding our logout button - it’s still the upper right most button in qube, but now newer! different! flashier!</p>

<p><em>*Note that no functionality has changed - logging out will still reset qube (and will recover disappearing notification problems resulting from stale browser states). No prescription or administrator permission is required to logout. I repeat, the log out button is not cough syrup, so do not use sparingly when problems occur.</em></p>

<h2 id="an-unparalleled-guest-experience">AN UNPARALLELED GUEST EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>Sure, every company says they treat their guests like royalty. But do they offer a complimentary crown to each and every guest? I don’t think so.</p>

<h2 id="increased-productivity-and-wellbeing">INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY AND WELLBEING</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.ngia.com.au/Attachment?Action=Download&amp;Attachment_id=1430">Research</a> has shown that “just one plant per workspace” has a large positive impact on stress and performance. Now, the sample size on this study was rather small, and research on virtual plants is rather limited - so to compensate we threw in four plants and a fish for good measure.</p>

<h2 id="increased-happiness">INCREASED HAPPINESS</h2>

<p>Some of you have complained that a sad turtle modal appears too frequently. We’ve addressed this BUT I just want to say that personally, I don’t think you can ever see too many <a href="https://external-preview.redd.it/lqbsuqaPsbH49jGkyuafUyTsjLlhBa72qi1nFah__S0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=467f4722c010955a53d581ac21a789c689d5654e">sad turtles</a>.</p>
